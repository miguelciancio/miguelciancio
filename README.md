### Hi there. \o/

## Welcome everyone to my GitHub!

I am currently in the middle of the proccess to become a **Software Engineer** and I am looking forward to collaborate with other people that have the same interests as mine. My current focus now is in learning **_Python_** and **_SQL_**.

Please, feel free to ask me anything that you might want to because I am going to be more than willing to help you.

You can also try to reach me on my email address: _mciancio.figueiredo@gmail.com_.

Thank you for dropping by,
Miguel.
